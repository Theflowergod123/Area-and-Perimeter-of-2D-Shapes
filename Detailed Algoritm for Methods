- get user input
  - ask user to enter values for l and h (or whichever variables are required for the given shape)
  - make sure side lengths are float or integer variables (exception handling)
  
- display results 
  - output area and perimeter of the given shape
  - if triangle shape is chosen, output triangle type
  
- calculate perimeter
  - overload original method depnding on shape
    - rectangle: 2l + 2h
    - triangle: l + y + z
    - square: 4l
   
- calculate area
  - overload original method depending on shape
    - rectangle: l * h
    - triangle: (l * h)/2
    - square: l^2
    
- triangle types
  - if sides l, y and z are the same size, it is an equilateral
  - if 2 of the 3 sides are equal, it is isosceles
  - if none of the sides are equal it is scalene
